# Devlog: 2025-11-19

## Focus

Initial repository creation and documentation for graph-native filesystem concept using `.edge/` convention.

## What Happened

### Completed

**Concept exploration:**
- Discussed graph-native filesystem idea with user
- Refined `.edge/` directory convention through conversation
- Explored path syntax options (settled on `.edge/` over `@` sigil)
- Validated that concept works with pure POSIX today

**Repository setup:**
- Created `bukzor/ideation.graph-fs` repository on GitHub
- Initial documentation attempt (later restructured)
- Applied CC0 license

**Documentation restructure:**
- Recognized violation of LLM-collaborative documentation standards
- Restructured following proper separation of concerns:
  - README.md: Minimal user-facing introduction
  - CLAUDE.md: Quick reference for future LLM sessions
  - STATUS.md: Current milestone and next actions
  - docs/dev/design-rationale.md: Why decisions were made
  - docs/dev/technical-design.md: How system works
  - docs/dev/development-plan.md: Roadmap and milestones
  - docs/examples/: Practical use cases
  - docs/dev/devlog/: This log

### Attempted

N/A - All planned work completed

### Discovered

**Key insights:**
- POSIX paths already support graphs (hardlinks prove this)
- `.edge/` directories work with all existing tools
- Convention can be adopted immediately without any implementation
- Multiple paths to same inode already handled by POSIX (pwd, find)

**Design decisions validated:**
- Symlinks better than hardlinks (directories, cross-filesystem)
- User-defined edge types better than fixed schema (early exploration)
- Convention-first better than implementation-first (validate cheaply)

## Decisions Made

### Use `.edge/` Convention

**Rationale:** Pure POSIX, discoverable, works today with zero implementation

**Alternatives:** `@type/` sigil, `/path:type/` syntax, new kernel primitives

**Impact:** Immediate usability, but slightly longer paths

### Symlinks for Edges

**Rationale:** Work for directories, cross filesystems, show relationship semantics

**Alternatives:** Hardlinks, hybrid approach

**Impact:** Possible broken links, but clearer semantics and broader applicability

### Documentation Structure

**Rationale:** Follow LLM-collaborative standards for better long-term maintainability

**Alternatives:** Keep flat structure with long README

**Impact:** More files, but proper separation of concerns (why/what/how)

## Open Questions

### Should this repo self-host the convention?

Create `.edge/` directories to demonstrate the concept on itself?

Examples:
- `docs/dev/.edge/references/` → link to external resources
- `docs/examples/.edge/relates_to/` → link to specific design docs
- Documentation files with `.edge/derived_from/` showing sources

**Next session consideration:** Apply convention to this repo as validation.

### What are the most valuable early use cases?

Neo4j export? Build system integration? Documentation graphs?

Need real-world validation to prioritize tool development.

## Next Session

**Start here:** Apply `.edge/` convention to this repository

**Tasks:**
1. Identify relationships within the documentation
2. Create `.edge/` directories with appropriate types
3. Add edges (symlinks) expressing those relationships
4. Document the experience and any friction encountered

**Blockers:** None
